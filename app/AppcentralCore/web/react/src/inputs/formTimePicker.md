# Time Picker

This compnent is an AppCentral wrapper for the Syncfusion `TimePickerComponent` from '@syncfusion/ej2-react-calendars'.  See the documentation on Syncfusion's website for more info [https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/demos/#/bootstrap/timepicker/default].

Most of the time the time picker will be in a form, and the form will be handled by `redux-form`.  In this case, the input will be wrapped in the redux-form `<Field>` component.  The field component will handle the input object automatically. 

## TODO:
Get the meta (touched, error, warning) working.
